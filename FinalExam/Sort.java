/* What is algorithm? Write algorithm using pseudo code to sort a list of numbers. */

// Algorithm is a process or set of rules or steps to solve a problem. Before writing a program, you need to find out the steps to be followed to solve a problem. This process is called algorithm. Algorithm is written in simple English like code called pseudo code which is not specific to any programming language.

// Algorithm: Bubble Sort
// Input: A list of numbers L
// Output: A sorted list L'

// 1. Begin
// 2. Do
//     2.1 Set 'swapped' to False
//     2.2 For i from 0 to length of L - 2
//         2.2.1 If L[i] > L[i+1]
//             2.2.1.1 Swap L[i] with L[i+1]
//             2.2.1.2 Set 'swapped' to True
//     2.3 End For
// 3. While 'swapped' is True
// 4. Return L
// 5. End
